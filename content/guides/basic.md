This article aims to teach you how to use the app NextBusSG. If you haven't downloaded the app, click <nuxt-link to="/#download">here</nuxt-link> to do so.

## 1. Viewing bus timings

When you open the app, you will see a list of bus stops nearby. Clicking on any of them will reveal a list of bus services:

<ImgComp src="basic/stopsservices.png" />

As you can see, the bus stop **Bedok Stn Exit A** has the bus servies **2**, **9**, **24**, **25**, etc. operating. If, for example, you want to see when **bus 24** is arriving, look for **24** in the list of bus services:

<ImgComp src="basic/service-tile.png" />

The number in black is the bus number (24), and the other three numbers are the bus arrival times. From the image we see the following bus arrival times:

- Arr (the bus has arrived)
- 12 minutes
- 22 minutes

That's all you need! You may also see the level of crowded of the bus depending on the color of the timings:

- <Clr color="green">Green</Clr> means no crowd
- <Clr color="orange">Yellow</Clr> means little crowd
- <Clr color="red">Red</Clr> means overcrowded

So all three bus 24s have a regular load.
