This article aims to walk you through the basics of NextBusSG â€“ viewing bus arrival timings and adding bus preferred services to your favorites. If you haven't downloaded the app, click <nuxt-link to="/#download">here</nuxt-link>. It's strongly recommend that you go through the tutorial that comes when you first launch the app.

## 1. Viewing bus timings

When you open the app, you will see a list of bus stops nearby, based on your current location. Clicking on any of them will reveal a list of bus services:

<ImgComp src="basic/bus-timings-demo.png" :fullwidth="true" />

In the above screen, the bus stop **Bedok Stn Exit A** has the bus servies **2**, **9**, **24**, **25**, etc. operating. If, for example, you want to see when **bus 9** is arriving, look for **9** in the list of bus services:

<ImgComp src="basic/service-tile.png" />

The number in black is the bus number (9), and the other three numbers are the bus arrival times. From the image we see the following bus arrival times:

- <Clr color="green">6 m</Clr>inutes
- <Clr color="orange">21 m</Clr>inutes
- <Clr color="red">29 m</Clr>inutes

If it says "Arr", the bus has arrived.

That's all you need! You may also see the level of crowded of the bus depending on the color of the timings:

- <Clr color="green">Green</Clr>: no crowd
- <Clr color="orange">Yellow</Clr>: little crowd
- <Clr color="red">Red</Clr>: overcrowded

## 2. Adding favorites

Let's say you take **bus 14** at **Bedok Int** often. You can add this to your favorites as follows.

First, tap on the on the number **14**, and you'll see a popup to confirm adding the service to your favorites:

<ImgComp src="basic/favorites-prompt.png" />

Click on the <Clr color="accent">**Yes**</Clr> button to add it. It is possible to add multiple favorites from each bus stop. If, for example, you've added buses 9 and 14 from Bedok Int, you will see this in your favorites:

<ImgComp src="basic/favorites.png" />

You can add all your frequently used bus services to your favorites.


### Location-aware favorites

When you open the app the next time, if you have any favorites that are close to your current location, they will be shown at the top of the screen.

If none of your favorites are nearby, the app will show you a list of all near by bus stops.
